# StackOverflow-Survey2021-Exploration

[TOC]

## Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interested in using Stack Overflow Survey 2021 to better understand:

1. Is gender compensation discrimination exited in soft developers
2. Is employment status related to mental health problem?
3. Which are five jobs have lowest average salary?

## File Descriptions

The notebook here shows the work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. 

The folder `stack-overflow-developer-survey-2021` contains the raw data.

## Result

Q1: At first look, female developers are less paid than male developers. After taking coding experience, firms' size, education level and locations into consideration, I don't find statistical support the existence of  gender compensation discrimination. 

Q2: Employment status is related the mental health problem. 

Q3: Student, academic researcher, Mobile Developer, educator, gamer or graphic developer are the five jobs with the lowest average salary
